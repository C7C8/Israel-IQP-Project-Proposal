\section{Introduction}

Modern Israel relies on conventional (gasoline and diesel-powered) vehicles for transportation. With nearly 70\% of Israeli citizens driving to work and another 18\% taking buses, commute times have increased 30\% over the past decade \cite{Dori2018IsraeliRoads}, increasing oil consumption and worsening the dependence on it. The environmental impacts of oil usage are well known, but in Israel's case oil usage is more problematic. Israel produces only a few thousand barrels of oil per day and therefore imports 99\% of its oil \cite{Engber2006WhereOil}. In modern times this oil comes from Russia, Egypt, and other nearby Arabic nations -- considering Israel's troubled past with its neighbors and several oil crisis incidents and treaties \cite{Engber2006WhereOil}, Israel has serious motivation to decrease its reliance on oil in favor of more readily available sources of power.

To that end, Eilat is investigating the possibility of heavily promoting electric vehicles (EVs), along with related infrastructure and possibly a vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging system. Briefly, electric vehicles are vehicles such as cars, buses, or even trucks that rely on traction power generated from an electric motor instead of an engine, and powered by a very high capacity lithium-ion battery instead of gasoline. Electric cars are up to 4 times more efficient than traditional internal combustion vehicles, and have been successfully demonstrated in cars such as the Tesla Roadster, with a range of up to 393 km \cite{Friel2010ManagementVehicles}. While this particular vehicle might be a higher end car, it's a good example of the viability of all-electric transportation.

Much work has already been done on investigating the benefits and drawbacks of EVs from economic, environmental, and engineering perspectives. As previously stated electric cars are well-known to be more energy efficient, but their overall impact varies with the source of the electricity. That is, if the energy is sourced from renewable sources (e.g. solar, the current best option for Eilat), all-electric is advantageous, while if the energy is sourced from fossil fuels like oil, it's more efficient to generate power on-board, such as in a hybrid electric vehicle \cite{Dincer2010EconomicOptions}, and the same goes for environmental effects. V2G charging is the idea of allowing two-way power flow between a car and the electric grid, allowing the car battery to supply power to the grid when needed, while charging when power is more readily available \cite{Mahmud2015PowerEV}. Unfortunately, the complicated equipment underpinning the idea are still under development \cite{2018Nuvve...} and have not been fully demonstrated in a complicated urban environment under real-world conditions.

The problem with applying efforts under development elsewhere to Eilat's situation is that they do not take into account Eilat's demographics and power sources. Eilat aims to transition to electric vehicles \textit{and} increase solar usage, which can interfere with part of the benefits of V2G --- charging would take place at times of decreased load, usually at night when solar panels coincidentally cannot generate power. Without adequate power management, it's entirely possible that an EV owner might wake up one morning only to find that their car has discharged completely overnight. Furthermore, without an understanding of what motivates Israelis to switch to electric cars (the average consumer is unwilling to pay extra in the name of environmental friendliness \cite{Mock2010MarketVehicles}) it will be difficult to determine how the city should properly incentivize its citizens. The applicability of V2G charging to Eilat has also not been investigated, with little to no data available on what sort of charging station frequency or range would be acceptable to those who want to switch. Finally, if Eilat wishes to switch both to solar panels and electric cars, serious upgrades to their power would be required \cite{Vardimon2011AssessmentIsrael}, but whether this is feasible or not is undetermined.

The goal of this project is to assess the technological viability and requirements of Eilat's goal to have 90\% electric vehicles by 2040, and develop a roadmap for its implementation in order to aid the city of Eilat in switching to electric vehicles. We aim to determine what the most effective economic incentive to switch is, to determine the maximum price that Eilat consumers would be willing to pay, what the maximum range of the cars should be, and investigate the potential for charging stations in Eilat. Although adapting the technology to Eilat's situation and convincing citizens to convert to EVs may prove challenging, it opens unique opportunities. Eilat's effort can prove V2G's potential, demonstrate a working EV-powered city, and act as a role model for other cities looking to switch to a majority of EVs.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Transportation}[Evan G.]
Eilat is a relatively small city with a population of 47,800. Within the city center, you can walk almost everywhere. There is only one bus company, Egged. \cite{TransportationEilat} "Get Taxi", an Uber-like service, is also available. 

In March 2018, a report published by the Bank of Israel found that commute times in the country have increased by 30\% in the last decade. This is likely because private and commercial vehicles account for how 69\% of Israelis get to work nationwide. Following that, 18\% take a bus. Tel Aviv and Haifa are very close to the national numbers, but in Jerusalem, the statistic changes drastically, to 54\% car and 32\% bus \cite{Dori2018IsraeliRoads}. By comparison, in European cities like Barcelona and Brussels public transportation accounted for 40\% of all commuting and in Paris, 70\%. The report found that those who do take the bus to work do so not because it is convenient or efficient, but because they cannot afford to own a car, and therefore have no choice. The report came after the International Monetary Fund said Israel’s transportation infrastructure was insufficient and was threatening to be a drag on economic growth. 

The stop and go movements of vehicles in heavy traffic is a major case for the use of electric vehicles. A gas-powered vehicle is inefficient while idling. In the US, this accounts for 10.6 billion gallons of fuel per year, or 7.4\% of all gasoline consumption. Electric vehicles would eliminate this wasted power by using no energy while stopped. Additionally, when slowing down, EVs could recharge their batteries by converting their kinetic energy to stored electrical energy through a process called "regenerative breaking."

Israeli car ownership has increased rapidly in the past 20 years. In 1995, car ownership was climbing at 6-7\% per year --- among the fastest in the world at the time \cite{Slater1995IsraelCulture}. A 2012 report from the Israel Tax Authority showed that car owners in the center and north of the country drove the least --- around 14,000 kilometers a year on average between the Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa areas --- while car owners in far-north Metula area drove the most, at 22,000 kilometers a year. Eilat car owners, who are the farthest from the country’s center, drove the second most at 19,000 kilometers a year \cite{Schmil2012WhatHow}. The report states that between 1995 and 2011, tax revenue from cars more than doubled. Additionally, whether due to increasing green-awareness or Israel’s Green Tax Reform, cars on Israel's roads are becoming less damaging to the environment\cite{Schmil2012WhatHow}.

%Luxury car ownership has also increased rapidly, doubling in recent years \cite{Weinglass2018Rev-upIsrael}. Economist Yaron Zalicha told the Times of Israel: “The low interest rates of recent years allowed car purchasers to borrow more money and incentivized consumption over saving. …In addition, the government recently made it easier for people to import cars individually, which incentivizes the import of expensive cars” \cite{Weinglass2018Rev-upIsrael}. Some see the rise of luxury cars as being a direct result of a growing economy. As in many places, there is a stigma against owning a luxury car. It is a common stereotype in Israel that the owners of luxury cars are criminals or tax evaders. This is partly because until a new law goes into effect in 2019 it is legal in Israel to purchase apartments and cars using cash.

%Israel does not have a particularly thriving car culture scene. This is largely limited by the government. Speed limits are low, and every single modification to a vehicle, even changing the wheel size, requires special permission. New car purchases are taxed at 83\%, making the purchase of a car very expensive.

\subsection{Electric Vehicles and Solar Power}[Christopher M.]
\subsubsection{Electric Vehicles}
Electric vehicles (EVs) are an energy efficient alternative to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), relying on built in lithium-ion batteries to store power and electric motors to generate traction to move the vehicle. ICEVs produce carbon dioxide (CO$^2$, a known greenhouse gas) emissions from burning gasoline, but convert 10-15\% of the chemical energy within into traction that moves the car. In comparison, a hybrid vehicle --- combining both combustion and EV technology --- can yield 30-40\% efficiency \cite{Zhu2015DistributedGrid}. For a more concrete example, gasoline has a known energy density of 9.5 kWh/liter \cite{EngineeringFactors}, and a 2018 Honda civic sedan has 46.9 liter tank with a fuel efficiency of 14.9 km/l \cite{20182018Information}. This means it can store 445.5 kWh with a range of 698 km. In comparison, a Tesla Roadster has a max range of 393 km but a battery capacity of only 60 kWh \cite{Friel2010ManagementVehicles}, making the Roadster over 4 times more energy efficient despite its lower range.

As can be seen, EVs are currently limited in both battery capacity and range, presenting a usage-awareness challenge to consumers who wish to switch. On the low end of the scale, cars can have as little as 18.8 kWh batteries with a range of only 160 km, while higher end models like the Tesla Roadster from above have 60 kWh batteries and a range of 393 km \cite{20182018Information}. For reference, Israelis use 6,893 kWh in electric power per capita as of 2018 \cite{2018Key2018}. Depending on travel habits and local availability of charging stations. The key factor in EV range is battery capacity, which unfortunately remains expensive, costing up to 1,000 USD/kWh in 2010 \cite{Mock2010MarketVehicles}, although future projections estimate that \$200-300/kWh is a realistic goal and mass production is likely to further reduce expense. Range is a known concern of drivers, who on their own have little incentive to switch to EVs \cite{Mock2010MarketVehicles}, so the best possible range and availability of charging stations is essential.

\subsubsection{Charging and Power Requirements}
EVs have significant power requirements while charging that require special accommodations. Chargers are broken down into levels 1-4, with increasing charge rate and infrastructure requirements as you progress along the scale. Modes 1 and 2 are most common currently and consist of simply plugging the EV into AC power (mode 2 has a special in-line control box for added safety) \cite{Bossche2010ElectricInfrastructure}, using hardware built into the car to convert AC to DC power. These chargers are considered less safe but are ideal for opportunity charging (plugging in your car whenever parked for an extra top-up) and don't require special infrastructure, although they can take up to 18 hours to fully charge a car at a rate of 1.4-3.3 kW \cite{Ustun2015ImpactSystems} (for reference, a typical laptop might draw 60-70 W while charging). Mode 3 requires dedicated supply equipment and is considered safer than both 1 and 2 due to built-in safety systems such as auto-poweroff when not plugged in. Mode 4 is similar but requires even heavier equipment and uses its own equipment to convert AC to DC power. Both modes 3 and 4 ("fast charging") require anywhere from 50-250 kW \cite{Ustun2015ImpactSystems, Bossche2010ElectricInfrastructure} to charge, which needs specialized infrastructure beyond current residential or industrial outlets, but at a bonus of recharging a car in as little as 10 minutes. However, this might be overkill, since even most European consumers drive 50km/day or less and Israel drives even less than Europe, so "semi-fast" charging that draws up to 22 kW is probably suitable for most people \cite{Bossche2010ElectricInfrastructure}. Regardless, the Eilat electric grid is designed to accommodate typical residential loads such as the aforementioned 6,893 kWh/year, not thousands of 22 kW loads spread across the city, so the increased energy demand and strain on existing infrastructure would be enormous.

\subsubsection{Solar Energy}
To help satisfy the enormous energy requirements of an EV powered city and reduce carbon emissions, a number of renewable energy options are available to Eilat and Israel as a whole, most notably solar power. Solar power requires large amounts of exposure to the sun and huge swathes of land to generate power effectively. Modern photovoltaic solar panels are only 10-17\% efficient \cite{Zhu2015DistributedGrid}), generating 150-200 watts per square meter, so supplying Israel with its average demand of 6.7 gigawatts would require 33-45 km$^2$ of contiguous solar panels, or widespread rooftop deployment to help satisfy a fraction of current demand \cite{Vardimon2011AssessmentIsrael}.

Unfortunately, the volatile nature of solar energy (affected by weather but entirely dependent on time of day, solar panels cannot generate power during the night) can cause problems with satisfying power demand and stabilizing power supply \cite{Lu2015IntroductionPEVs}, and the deployment of dedicated solar farms would likely require significant upgrades to the existing power grid \cite{Vardimon2011AssessmentIsrael} in both capacity and technology. Combined with the high energy demands imposed by a fleet of electric vehicles, a desperately-needed increase in solar power and 90\% EVs (as per Eilat's goal) can be expected to require significant changes to Eilat's electrical grid.

\subsubsection{Vehicle-to-Grid Charging}
One possibility for alleviating these concerns is the idea of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) charging. V2G charging centers around the idea of allowing two-way power flow between the grid and EVs connected to it for charging, instead of the traditional idea of one-way charging where you plug your car in and get a charge. Control and monitoring equipment built into the charger in collaboration with large scale grid monitoring could determine when power more readily available in the grid vs. when it's badly needed and decide whether the car charges its battery or discharges to help supplement the power supply. For instance, a well-known phenomenon is "peak time" when the work day ends, people go home, and power usage spikes. During these times, V2G-charging cars could serve as a distributed battery, discharging into the grid to relieve stress on power generators, while charging up during the nighttime in time to be driven in the morning \cite{Mahmud2015PowerEV}. While one car on its own might not have too much power, in large amounts the effect could be enormous. For reference, in 2017 Tesla built a 129 MWh battery in southern Australia which reduced service costs by 90\% \cite{Lambert2018Teslas90} --- if each EV had a battery capacity of 60 kWh, it would take exactly 2,150 of them to equal Australia's battery, or one EV for less than 5\% of Eilat's population. This makes V2G technology a serious option to mitigate a potential Eilat power crisis.

\subsection{Existing Automotive Industry}[Zachary Z.]

Israel is not traditionally considered a strong player within the global automotive industry, as they have continued to import most of their automobiles from other countries. As of 2015, 254,000 vehicles were imported to Israel - only to increase by 12\% in 2016 to a total of 286,728 vehicles \cite{}. In addition, 1,004,019 of the vehicles on Israel's roads as of 2017 were 3 years old or under (cite Halavy). This constant influx of cars due to an assumed increase in Israeli wealth has caused the few manufacturers that reside in Israel to become obsolete compared to other big manufacturers abroad including Hyundai, Toyota, and Kia (cite Car Loan World, Jerusalem Post**). Numbers like these would come as a shock to most when they consider that Israel imposes an effective tax rate of 75\% on any imported vehicle. This means that an imported \$5000 car would effectively cost the average consumer \$8850 (nbn.org). 

All of this being said, Israel does have a reputation as a breeding ground for start-ups to thrive. One example of a forward-looking start-up is "Mobileye," who has partnered with Intel and BMW to create a fully autonomous car by the year 2021. This would seemingly reduce traffic buildup in busy areas, reduce crash rates, and ensure a quicker commute (cite money.cnn). Ethical considerations would need to be taken into account however, and it would most likely only encounter widespread adoption once the cars are exponentially better drivers than humans. While the technology is not there yet, the Israeli firm has already begun testing these and it should only be a matter of time before they are available to the public.  

With regard to EVs, there are few efforts being made within Israel 

%Israel is not traditionally considered a strong player within the global automotive industry; however, they are proving to be a country on the rise in this regard. As a nation, Israel is known for the environment it has provided for technology start-ups to thrive. That in mind, many global brands are deciding to invest in the "high-end automotive technology sector." Some of these global brands include Intel, looking to apply its software automation in Jerusalem; Volkswagen AG, trying to popularize the ride hailing service called "Gett,"; even BMW AG, who made a large investment in a transit app called "Moovit" \cite{Coutinho2018IsraelIndustry}. 

%With regard to the traditional facets of the automotive industry, the Israeli market also has companies specializing in Tier 1, 2, and Tier 3 supply; Tier 1 supplying companies with components for final assembly as well as aftermarket spare parts, Tier 2 supplying Tier 1 with sub-assembly components, and Tier 3 supplying simple engineered materials for Tier 2 suppliers, respectively. As of 2015, Israel has over 60 companies working in Tier 1 aftermarket supply creating spare parts and accessories such as batteries, ventilation, gears and valves. Israel also has over 50 companies that supply sub-assembly components to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) \cite{MinistryofEconomyandIndustryStateofIsraelTheIsrael}. These companies may begin to shift over time as Israel seeks alternatives to traditional, inefficient cars, and moves toward lighter, smarter, and technologically savvy electric vehicles.

%Keeping in mind that Israel is looking to move toward smart cars and efficient vehicles, there are a number of notable trends occurring in the world right now. One shift being made is the reduction of vehicle weight by using alternative materials, given that a car that is 10\% lighter would use 6-8\% less fuel \cite{MinistryofEconomyandIndustryStateofIsraelTheIsrael}. Other popular trends lie in the information technology sector, enabling vehicles to communicate with other vehicles and become more automated. These technologies include driver assistance systems, automated and smart transportation, and information security. All of these technologies aim to reduce the inherent error that human drivers have, decreasing commute times, reducing the impact of potential crashes, and keeping personal information out of the hands of hackers \cite{MinistryofEconomyandIndustryStateofIsraelTheIsrael}. Directly related to this increase in technology within the automotive sector, there exist some ethical considerations that must be taken into account. While the idea of more efficient vehicles would not receive much opposition, technology which takes control from the driver is heavily debated. Questions regarding the culpability of the driver in certain situations come into play, as well as driver rights, manufacturer liability, and implications for future generations.

%Responding to this fundamental shift in the way the world is viewing transportation, Israel has responded with a few ideas of their own. For example, the trending navigation app "Waze" was based in Israel before they were bought out by Google in 2013. Waze encourages communication between drivers via a mobile app (not while driving obviously) where users can report traffic jams, vehicles stopped on the shoulder, hazards, and even police officers. Another Israeli company, "Cellint," monitors all active cell phones and detects their exact location on the roads every 30 seconds, collecting data to use for traffic management, research, and time-to-destination analysis. Other Israeli companies such as "Argus" aim to address the issue of information security, ensuring that data can be shared between vehicles seamlessly without interference from hackers \cite{MinistryofEconomyandIndustryStateofIsraelTheIsrael}. The list of Israel-based companies and their various applications goes on, however their goals all relate to creating safer, smoother and more efficient journeys for drivers.

%Overall, the Israeli automotive industry is a developing one. This is not to say that it is underdeveloped, but that it has focused its lens on emerging technologies and brand new global needs. International companies have focused their attention to Israel in search of new viable automobile-related technologies. In addition to the cutting-edge technologies that have sprouted in Israel, they also have made efforts to vertically integrate many of them - ensuring that there is support from initial design to final production \cite{MinistryofEconomyandIndustryStateofIsraelTheIsrael}. Israel's location enables them to get the best of both commercial worlds; they can easily trade with Asia and Europe.
\subsection{Israeli Economics}[Valeria K.]
\subsubsection{Oil Dependence}
Currently the State of Israel has a strong dependence on oil imports, which has contributed to already complicated ties with its neighboring nations in the Middle East. Israel produces incredibly small quantities of oil, as little as only a couple thousand barrels of oil a day \cite{Engber2006WhereOil}. Such a small oil production does not allow Israel to sustain more than 1\% of its oil needs, which means it imports over 99\% of its oil \cite{Engber2006WhereOil}. This generates an undesired and convoluted vulnerability for Israel. Since its establishment, the State of Israel has continuously sought oil resources closer to home in order to increase stability and safety as well as decreasing import costs. Its overall growth and increase of oil demand has further fostered Israel's need to decrease its dependence on other nations for almost the entirety of their oil resources. 

Ideally, Israel can decrease its dependence on other nations by decreasing its oil consumption. Focusing on the development of energy consumption in future years progressing towards the use of renewable energy instead of oil consumption would yield great benefits in terms of environmental, social and political aspects. This can be achieved by focusing on renewable energy production and shifting towards electric machines, such as EVs, versus oil-run machines. Israel has the opportunity to expand upon its untapped potential for renewable energy production, especially solar polar, which would grant Israel an increased independence from its oil imports and undesired ties to neighboring countries.

\subsubsection{Economic Incentives}
An important aspect to take into account in regards to implementation of EVs and V2G in Eilat is the use of economic incentives. An economic incentive can be understood to be a something that influences people in a way that causes them to behave in a certain way or make certain decisions (*). This is often adopted by governments in order to encourage behaviour from their country’s populations, and the implementation of EVs is the perfect example for this. In order to successfully transition the city of Eilat into 90\% EV usage the city’s population’s willingness to adopt EVs is crucial. This goes to say, no matter the plan that the government develops, if the population does not choose to adopt it buy purchasing and using EVs, then there is no way to ensure the success of such a plan. 

That being said, the government has the power to incentivise people to choose EVs, and given that people generally react most strongly to matters regarding finances, economic incentives are on of the best ways to motivate people to adopt EVs. There are multiple ways of incentivising populations to invest in EVs versus regular cars, which is ultimately the decision that determines whether Eilat can achieve 90\% EV usage by 2040. One of the most common economic incentive is tax cuts, in this case decreasing purchasing taxes or allowing for full purchasing tax exemptions (for EVs and not for traditional cars) can be incredibly effective (*). Taxes on cars in Israel are among the highest in the world at 83\%, which is five times higher than most European countries (*). It is estimated that it can take up to 28\% of the average Israeli’s salary to be able to afford a car (*), which makes this incentive even more appealing to Israeli citizens and has the potential to be especially motivating for consumers to switch to EVs. Additionally, the government could potentially allow charging stations installed around the city to be free of charge. This would represent significant savings for citizens by eliminating their personal oil costs. 

Additional to economic incentives the government can also implement non-monetary incentives. A group of EV owners in Norway said the strongest incentive for them was exemptions from road tolls and bus lane access (*). In the state of California EV users are allowed free municipal parking and access to the carpool lane (*). 

Among these various forms of economic incentives there can be clear distinctions among different groups in the population. Factors such as gender, age, and education influence people in regards to what would incentivise them to purchase an EV. Identifying these and the composition of a population is crucial to determining what the most effective use of incentives for a particular city or country is.


\subsection{Summary}

Overall, Israel stands to gain much by decreasing its oil reliance, increasing solar power production, and switching to electric vehicles. In the process it would gain a more reliable power system, greener vehicles, and reduced political difficulties involved with importing oil from its less-than-friendly neighbors. However, the process of making the switch over the next 20 years can be expected to be complicated, with numerous technological developments required, in-depth study of the social effects and social feasibility of electric vehicles, and possibly mitigation to avoid threatening the Israeli automotive industry. Additional research and investigation is required to determine the feasibility and implications of Eilat's plan to switch to 90\% electric vehicles by 2040.\
